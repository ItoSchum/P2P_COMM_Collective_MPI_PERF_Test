Communication among multiple nodes plays a critical role in the performance of High Performance Computing. MPI \cite{clarke1994mpi} offers a great number of libraries to maximize and test the communication performance in the parallel computing networks. The message passing has been observed to spend additional time in transfering information from one node to another, and several parallel models have been devised to properly describe the phenomenon, which in terms serve as criteria for future benchmarking. In this work, we build a collective MPI performance test to evaluate the performance among different models. To accomplish this, we have a parallel version of Game of Life program optimized with MPI communication scheme and CUDA for GPU parallelization. As far as the authors are concerned, this work could be the first intend to verify the networking perforamnce of a GPU-aided program in terms of different paralllel models. In terms of hardware, the benchmarking takes place on AiMOS \cite{aimos}, an eight petaflop supercomputer using a heterogenous system architecture built with IBM POWER9 CPUs and NVIDIA GPUs. On the software side, the program relies on IBM Spectrum MPI and NVidia CUDA math library \cite{aimosibm}.
