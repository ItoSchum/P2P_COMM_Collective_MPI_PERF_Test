AiMOS adopts MPI Spectrum as its message passing interface library. The MPI Spectrum is developed by IBM as a high-performance, production quality implementation of MPI to accelerate end-to-end communication. MPI Spectrum is based on the open-source MPI library, but is integrated with improved RDMA networking add supports NVIDIA GPUs based on IBM PAMI backend. Another feature is that MPI Spectrum enhaces collective library running blocking and non-blocking algorithms \cite{IBMmpiSpectrum}.
